(draft post on forum)
I've decided to make some minor adjustments to my own copy of nethack in an attempt to improve the balance of the game. I'm not an expert player, so I figure I should post my thoughts here and see what feedback I get.

So, here are my thoughts so far:
In my view, the main problem with Nethack is is that the end-game is typically easy to the point of being tedious. Early in the game, one has to play cautious and careful attention to everything, watch out for traps, use special combat tactics to fight monsters, make strategic retreats etc. But there comes a point when the player becomes so powerful that nothing is really a threat anymore.

The changes I've made so far are as follows:

- increased max lvl of random monsters from (dlvl + clvl)/2 to (dlvl +clvl)/2 + turns/10000

I've also made some changes that aren't directly balance related:

 - made it possible to refresh spell knowledge sooner (ie. reread a spell book). I've changed it from only being possible with < 1000 turns, to < 5000 turns. I've also added a visual indicator to the spells list to show when it is possible to reread the spell book.
- decreased probability of seeing bones from 1/3 to 1/5
- increased probability of saving bones from 1-(1 / (1 + dlvl/4)) to 1-(1 / (1 + dlvl/3))

I like seeing bones when I play, but I don't like seeing the bones of my recent character every time. So I've made those bones change to make bones a bit more unpredictable (since I'm the only one who plays on this computer).






[Note: this is a long post. I had a few breaks while writing it. Please don't feel like you need to read it all at once!]

I was pretty happy with vanilla nethack, but after downloading the source code to fix a bug that was preventing me from using the font I wanted, I found myself spotting all sorts of stuff in the game that I thought should be changed. Suddenly nothing was sacred. In another thread I talked about how I've added a display for the weights of items in the inventory screen. In this thread I want to talk a bit about some of the balance changes I've made. I hope that I can get feedback from some experienced players, to help me decide whether the changes will make the game better or worse, and whether or not they are true to the spirit of nethack.

Ok. I'll list what I've changed so far, roughly in order from the most minor to the more significant.

I've used the "pickup_thrown" patch, http://bilious.homelinux.org/?98, the "Harmonic Scoring" patch, http://bilious.homelinux.org/?358 , a dumpfile patch, and I've added display for items weights. I think these are pretty uncontroversial changes, because they don't really affect balance.

I've decreased prob of loading bones from 1/3 to 1/5, and increased prob of saving bones from 1-(1 / (1 + dlvl/4)) to 1-(1 / (1 + dlvl/3)). My motivation for this change is that I wanted to see some older bones. I'm the only one who plays on this computer, and I got sick of only ever seeing the bones of my very recent characters. By reducing the loading prob, bones last a bit longer before they are discovered. I don't see this as an important change.

I've made it possible to refresh knowledge of spells sooner (ie. rereading spellbooks to make knowledge of the spell keener); changed from 1000 remaining turns to 5000 remaining turns. I've also added a visual indicator on the spell list to show which spells can be refreshed.

I've decreased xp required for lv 12 and above. It use to be have exp growth up to lv20, then linear. Now it is exp to lv12, then quadratic. The reason for this change is that I've found it becomes pretty much impossible to level-up after the low teens (apart from direct level gain from potions/wraiths/foobus). The effects of this change are pretty minor... it still takes a ridiculous number of kills to level up. I'm considering reducing it further, but I'm happy enough with it for now.

Now.. onto the more major changes. Let me just say that the main motivation for the following changes is that I believe the end-game is far too easy. Nethack is very very difficult at the start of the game. The player has to be careful to search for traps, flee from monsters, conserve items, etc; but towards the end of the game the player is basically immune to everything and can just charge around, effortlessly slaying room-fulls of arbitrary strong monsters. I want to make the end game a bit harder, and possibly make the early game a bit easier to compensate. So here's what I've done (still in order of smallest to largest):

I've reduced the protection bought from priests. Instead of turning probabilistic at +9 and maxing out at +20, it now turns probabilistic at +5 and maxes out at +14; however, the probability has been increased a bit. Also lowered initial range form 2-5 to 1-3. So typically this protection will now give around +5 or 6 instead of +9.

I've changed the formula for the maximum level of random monsters from (clvl + dlvl)/2 to (clvl + turns/1000 +1 + 2*dlvl)/4. I think this change requires a bit of explaining; so bear with me. This formula describes how tough the monsters you meet are likely to be. In the original formula, the level of your character plays just as large a role as the depth of the dungeon. The effect of this is that the difficulty of monsters rises very quickly in the early game, and slows down later on; and also it acts as a strong disincentive for leveling up your character. I think it's bad that the monsters get strong quickly in the early game; and I think it's counter-intuitive that leveling up is a bad thing. Under my new system, monsters get stronger as the game goes on, regardless of how you are spending your turns. Characters are less harshly penalized for leveling up, and instead they are penalized for dilly-dallying. It becomes less advantageous to spend a long time farming; and more advantageous to get on with the job of finding the amulet. One way to compare the two formulas is to think about when they will be equal. The new one will equal the old one when your character level is equal to 1 + moves/1000. So if you've taken fewer moves than that, the monsters will be weaker than usual, and if you've taken more moves they will be stronger. For example, suppose at turn 1210 my character is level 5 and I'm on dungeon level 3. Under the old system, the monster level cap would be (3+5)/2 == 4. With the new system it would be (2*3 + 1210/1000 + 1 + 5)/4 == (6+1+1+5)/4 == 3. (it always rounds towards zero). So the monsters would be slightly weaker at that stage of the game.

A typical ascension is around 35,000 turns. Based on that, I estimate that my formula will make the early game a little bit easier, and the mid-to-late game harder.


Finally, one last change, probably with the most significant change; and I'm a bit unsure about it. I've adjusted the probabilies ascociated with armour "mc" (magic negation, the code). Originally, the probability of a blockable magic attack succeeding was as follows:
mc=0, p=100%
mc=1, p=67%
mc=2, p=35%
mc=3, p+2%

As I've said, I think the late game is a bit too easy. In particular I don't like that the hero is essentially immune to all the special attacks that the late-game monsters can deal. I think it's a shame that some of the late-game monsters essentially never get to use their special attacks. For example, wraiths and vampires are laughable because their level drain attack almost always fails. I also don't like that mc has some a massive affect but is not displayed anywhere in the game. So here's what I've changed it to:

mc=0, p=100%
mc=1, p=50%
mc=2, p=25%
mc=3, p=17%

With this change, mc from armour is still very important but the difference is smaller between different armours. But more importantly, the best protection you can get is only a reduction to 17%, rather than 2%. So the nasty magic effects of monsters are much more likely to hurt you. This will have you backing away from wraiths and using ranged attacks rather than just steamrolling over them.


That's all.

That was a bit of an epic post. Feel free to take some time to think about it, and respond to any part of it, not necessily all at once. Thanks for reading.
